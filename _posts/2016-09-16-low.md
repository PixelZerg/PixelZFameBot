title: "Development at an all-time low!"

I have been spending well over 10 hours every day trying to release this bot for you guys - It's currently at about 70% completion. However, let me get straight to the point: all of my electronic equipment has been confiscated (my PC, monitors, laptops, phone) because in the eyes of others, the amount of time I am spending on the computer does look pretty bad. I haven't been able to work on the bot properly in the last 5 days now. Basically, there's really not much I can do about my stuff getting confiscated. Looks like I'm going to have to visit internet cafes and stuff. Either way, I won't rest until this is done. Don't worry, it'll be fine - I just thought I would let you people know what's going on :/
