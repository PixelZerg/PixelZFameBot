I take security very seriously. Here I shall outline the various measures that I will be taking to ensure a secure system.

## Authenticating With My Server
To authenticate with my server, you will need to sign in to my server with your email and a password. They will both be encrypted with powerful **AES encryption**. Not only this, but the password will also be **hashed** and **salted** on top of that heavy encryption.

Hashing is when you use a complex algorithm to crush down the bytes (1s and 0s) of a password into a string of what looks like random characters. This is called the hash. If a single character in your password is different, the hash will be *completely* different. But if you don't change anything, then the hash result will always be *exactly* the same every time. Also, it is almost impossible to get the original password from a hash. What my server will do is that it will store the *hash* of your password rather than your actual password. When you submit the password to my server, the password you typed in will not be sent to my server. Instead, it will be hashed and the *hash* will be sent to my server. If the hash matches the hash that is in my server's database then I would know that the password is correct - and I could know this without ever knowing the actual password.
