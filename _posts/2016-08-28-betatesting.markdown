description: "Want to be a beta tester and help improve the program?"
---

As you may already know by know, closed beta testing may begin in the near future. Beta testers are going to be exactly the same as normal customers, however, they will be able to gain access to PixelZFameBot before everyone else - at the expense of the program being quite buggy and also having to report back to me about the program. I only need a couple of testers, a maximum of around 5 people. The subscription prices for the beta testers will also be 30% off.

Please understand that I will be looking for people who actually want to help me improve the program by testing the it out rather than people who merely want to have access to PixelZFameBot before everyone else. If you are signing up as a beta tester, do not have intentions of actually getting more fame. Instead, help me improve the program. The beta version of the program will be quite unstable anyway. I will expect reports about the program.

The program currently has some fatal bugs such as the client lagging out, the server crashing, etc.

If you do wish to apply to be a beta tester, please send your applications to <strong>pixelzerg@gmail.com</strong> with the subject <strong>PixelZFameBot Beta Testing</strong> and include in the email what you bring to the table.

NB: I still have some stuff to wrap up before I begin beta testing and that might take a while.
