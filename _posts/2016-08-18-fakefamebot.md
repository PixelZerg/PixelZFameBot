You might have even spotted them yourself, but there are some accounts, presumably made by the same person, in ROTMG that are spamming in the fame train server's nexus that PixelZFameBot - "PixelZerg's Fame Bot" - has been leaked (lol) and that by downloading the program from the link provided, you will be able to get the Fame Bot for free. The majority of you will have, just from this description, instantly guessed that this is obviously not genuine. But in case there is any confusion, let me make this crystal clear:
<ul>
<li>The claims are **fake**.</li>
<li>My bot has **not** been leaked.</li>
<li>I am **not** in any way affiliated with those accounts or the person(/people) behind them.</li>
<li>I did **not** create the accounts</li>
<li>I do **not** endorse their baseless claims about the performance of my bot.</li>
<li>DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE FILE. The file is malicious.</li>
<li>**I cannot be held liable for anything that happens as a result of you downloading the file(s) advertised by these fakers** (I told you not to)</li>
</ul>

Now let me highlight why this faker is so pathetic and amusing:
*  I have never sent the actual fame bot code to anyone **nor do I ever intend to**
*  Very few people are actually going to fall for this - all it is doing is giving me free publicity.
*  The .zip file that is provided contains just a single file when in actuality, PixelZFameBot requires a modified .swf client to go with the program.
*  The fake program needs administrator permissions: Alarm bells!
*  The fake program does not contain any .NET Assemblies (i.e: it is not written in C#) and PixelZFameBot is in C#
*  The faker claimed that the bot "auto-follows". Clearly he has absolutely no idea of how the bot works despite me outlining how it works it quite concisely in the description of the livestream and at various places on the forum website on which the bot gained popularity.
*  Best of all: Apparently the bot has been leaked ***without me have actually finished making it***

Whoops, looks like the faker forgot to do his homework!
