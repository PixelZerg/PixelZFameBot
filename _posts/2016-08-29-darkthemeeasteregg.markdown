This website now has a cool new feature that I added - you can change the display of any page of this development blog to to what I am calling the "Launcher Display". If you go to the console in your web browser and invoke the function "LauncherDisplay();", you can see a darker version of the page. You've probably guessed it - this is because that is how the website will appear in the PixelZFameBot Launcher which I will be working on soon. For now, though, it is just a cool little thing that you can do :wink:

Step 1 - write the command "LauncherDisplay();":
<div class="jimg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/public/poststuff/launcherdisplay/1.PNG"></div>

Step 2 - press enter. Wow:
<div class="jimg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/public/poststuff/launcherdisplay/2.PNG"></div>

lol.
