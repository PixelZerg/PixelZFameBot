PixelZFameBot is a  fame train bot for ROTMG made by me, PixelZerg. It started out as a proof-of-concept program, but due to its sudden popularity because of forum websites and this live-stream video that I uploaded on my channel:

I am now working hard on polishing up the program and improving the code so that I can release it in the nearby future. Please understand that creating a fully polished service out of a proof-of-concept program that I made without putting much thought into essential things such as code handling, the user interface, efficiency, etc is not something that can be done overnight. Thanks for everyone's patience.
